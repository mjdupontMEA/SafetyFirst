A number of breaking changes were introduced in v. 3.0.  This guide will help you understand these changes and how to update your codebase to work with the latest version of SafetyFirst.

### SafetyFirst, ResultDotNet, and OptionExt package merger

ResultDotNet and OptionExt packages are being merged into SafetyFirst to reduce the package overhead, since all three are often used together.  This means that once upgrading SafetyFirst to version 3.0, you can remove any references to ResultDotNet or OptionExt.  There will be some namespacing changes, since everything in the ResultDotNet namespace or OptionExt namespace have been converted over to the SafetyFirst namespace.  Additionally, for users of ResultDotNet, some of the functionality has been shuffled into different namespaces.  The `Result<_,_>` type for use from C# has been moved into a SafetyFirst.CSharp namespace.  Any C# code that references the `Result<_,_>` type directly will have to add a `using` statement for SafetyFirst.CSharp. There is only one `Result` module for use from both C# and F#, which is in the root SafetyFirst namespace.  This means that from F# code, there is no more .FSharp namespace to open.

### FSharp.Core update

SafetyFirst was updated to use FSharp.Core from F# 4.5 (FSharp.Core version 4.5.0).  This allows us to include ValueOptions in the project.  This includes merging in the ValueOption module from OptionExt, as well as providing a `str` function for F# that behaves much like the `string` function, but is safe for use with ValueOptions.  It also includes providing safe versions of the `transpose` function in the List/FSeq/Array modules (not in the Seq module, since it would diverge for infinite sequences).  Any project referencing SafetyFirst will likewise have to update FSharp.Core to at least version 4.5.0.

### Seq.NonEmpty.append and other functions of two or more sequences

The `append` function from each NonEmpty module was altered to take in a NonEmpty collection for both the left and right parameter (formerly, only the right parameter was NonEmpty).  There is now an `appendL` function and `appendR` function where only the left parameter and only the right parameter (respectively) are NonEmpty.  A similar pattern is found for many new functions in the Set.NonEmpty module for any functions working with two sets.  The simplest upgrade would be to replace any calls to `append` from (Seq/List/Array).NonEmpty with calls to `appendR`.

### Functions removed from the Seq module

Several functions have been removed from the Seq module, as they diverge for infinite sequences.  These include:

`average`
`averageBy`
`findBack`
`findIndexBack`
`last`
`max`
`maxBy`
`min`
`minBy`
`reduce`
`reduceBack`
`splitInto`

Where these functions are used, instead use the version in the FSeq module (or List or Array modules).  If the sequence is not known to be finite,
then calling these functions is a logic error.

Similarly, several functios have been removed from the Seq.NonEmpty module for the same reason.  These include:

`average`
`max`
`maxBy`
`min`
`minBy`
`reduce`
`length`
`fold`
`rev`

Again, where these functions are used, instead use the version in the FSeq.NonEmpty module (or List.NonEmpty or Array.NonEmpty).
